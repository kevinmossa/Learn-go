# Learn-go

## Welcome to my Learn Go repo

I will be posting my random Go projects that I build to practice Go.

### randPasswd

It generates a random 8 character password. Currently only contains upper and lower case letters. 

**TODO** 
I would like to also add digits and characters (/.?!\%$ etc)
